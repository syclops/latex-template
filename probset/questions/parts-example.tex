\titledquestion{Parts}

This is an example of a question with multiple parts.

\begin{parts}

  \part This is a sample part.

  \begin{solution}

    This is a solution to a part. It goes in its own \texttt{solution}
    environment.

  \end{solution}

  \part Now we will take a look at how a subpart works.

  \begin{subparts}

    \subpart This is a sample subpart.

    \begin{solution}

      This is a solution to a subpart. It also goes in its own
      \texttt{solution} environment.

    \end{solution}

    \subpart We can also have subsubparts, but let's not worry about that for
    now.

    \begin{solution}

      For any solution just place it in its own \texttt{solution} environment
      after the question text.

    \end{solution}

  \end{subparts}

\end{parts}
