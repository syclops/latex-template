\titledquestion{Fill in the Blank}

This is a fill in the \fillin[blank] question. If the solutions are being
printed, the blank will appear with the correct solution filled in.

To accommodate a long answer, add an optional second argument to the
\texttt{fillin} command to specify the length of the blank (which defaults to
one inch).

To accommodate a very short (i.e., one-letter) answer as to a true/false
question, use the \texttt{tf} command, which sets the length of the blank to a
quarter inch.
