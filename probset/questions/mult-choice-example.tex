\titledquestion{Multiple Choice}

This is an example of a multiple-choice question. Use the \texttt{choices}
environment to display each choice on its own line, and use the
\texttt{oneparchoices} environment to display the choices as part of the
paragraph. If instead of letters you want to use checkboxes, you can use the
\texttt{checkboxes} or \texttt{oneparcheckboxes} environments, respectively.

You can create a choice within the environment using the \texttt{choice}
command. If you want to indicate the correct choice so that it shows up properly
in the solutions, use the \texttt{CorrectChoice} command.

Here is an example using \texttt{oneparchoices}:

\begin{oneparchoices}

  \choice Incorrect

  \choice Also incorrect

  \choice Incorrect too

  \CorrectChoice Correct

\end{oneparchoices}
